bsa, block ssh attack

block addresses after several failed login attempts

get_addresses:
 started by rsyslogd, reads syslog output, records addresses


cronjobs

action
 checks recorded addresses and blocks them if appropriate

rm_addresses
 removes recorded addresses after certain time


keep in mind that recording of addresses is now done as files, but 
may be moved to a database, so keep record functions nicely separated.
